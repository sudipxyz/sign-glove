# âœ‹ Sign Glove â€“ Gesture to Speech Translator for the Mute

**Sign Glove** is a wearable device designed to help people who cannot speak communicate with others using verbal language. It uses **flex sensors** to detect finger gestures and converts them into speech through a **mobile app** built with MIT App Inventor.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem

Many people across the world who are mute rely on **sign language** for communication. However, most people do not understand sign language, making interaction difficult.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

The **Sign Glove** translates hand gestures (sign language) into **text and speech** using an Arduino and a smartphone app. This empowers non-verbal individuals to communicate more effectively with anyone.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Gesture recognition using **flex sensors**
- Real-time **serial output** of alphabet letters
- Bluetooth communication to Android app
- Mobile app that **displays and pronounces** the translated gestures

## ðŸ§° Components and Supplies

| Component               | Quantity |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Arduino UNO             | 1        |
| Flex Sensor             | 5        |
| Resistor (10kÎ©)         | 5        |
| Breadboard              | 1        |
| Jumper Wires            | As needed |
| USB OTG Cable           | 1        |

---

## ðŸ›  Tools

- Scotch Tape (for sensor positioning)
- Hot Glue Gun (for securing parts)

---

## ðŸ’» Platforms Used

- [MIT App Inventor 2](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) (for simulation)

---

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Flex sensors** are attached to each finger. As fingers bend, sensor resistance changes.
2. Arduino reads sensor values from analog pins:
    ```cpp
    a = analogRead(A0); // Thumb  
    c = analogRead(A1); // Index  
    d = analogRead(A2); // Middle  
    b = analogRead(A3); // Ring  
    e = analogRead(A4); // Little
    ```
3. Based on finger positions, it identifies letters of the alphabet. For example:
    ```cpp
    if (a < 900 && b > 900 && c > 900 && d > 900 && e > 900 && a > 800) {
      Serial.println("a");
    }
    ```
4. The app reads the **serial output via Bluetooth**, displays the letter, and speaks it out loud.
